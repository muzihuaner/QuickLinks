## Project Introduction

Quicklink is an out-of-the-box friend link power project. You only need to put the "Quicklink" logo or link on your webpage, submit it for review, and pass the review before you can use it.

Can be used to increase web traffic and make friends（李姐万岁~）

###### **Algorithm**

Whenever a user visits a webpage that has joined the Quicklinks, after clicking on the Quicklinks, it will ***\*randomly jump\**** to another webpage that has joined the Quicklinks. The more web pages that join Quicklinks, the greater the scale of link power and the greater the scale of shared traffic.

“Webpage A → Quicklinks → Webpage B → Quicklinks → Webpage C → Quicklinks → Webpage D → Quicklinks → Webpage E → Quicklinks → Webpage F… ”

## Apply

### 1.Your web page should meet:

- Willing to contribute to an open network (such as willing to share knowledge and experience, etc.)；
- There is no illegal content or content that affects the experience (such as intrusive ads, etc.)）；
- Normal update and maintenance (can be accessed in China will be removed)；
- 尽量使用https（没有也是可以的）;

### 2.Put the quick link on your webpage\**where you can see it after opening\** (let your friends link down):

- **Best Practices**：Add the external link of `quicklinks` (`https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/`) into your **top bar** navigation or **sidebar** navigation, **so that it is convenient for visitors to see and Click **:
  - For English navigation, use `QuickLinks`；
  - For Font Awesome, `fa-bolt` is recommended （[Preview](https://fontawesome.com/icons/bolt?style=solid)）；
  - For Emoji, recommended `⚡`；
- **Extra optional**: Put the fast chain logo on your bottom or other positions to indicate support for fast chain:
  - GIF：https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/assets/QuickLinks.gif
  - Dark PNG：https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/assets/dark.png
  - Light PNG：https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/assets/light.png
  - SVG：https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/assets/logo.svg
  - 💡Reference code: (QuickLinks.gif can be replaced with other pictures above to fit your webpage theme; width can limit the size of the picture to make the logo look more suitable.)

```html
<a href="https://myquicklinks.vercel.app/" target="blank" title="快链-友链接力">
    <img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/muzihuaner/QuickLinks@main/assets/QuickLinks.gif" alt="快链-友链接力" width="120">
</a>
```

- **Simple solution**: Insert the code above into a place where you can see it after opening your webpage, such as the top sidebar.

- **Seamless relay β**

It can be accelerated with jsdelivr, and there is no Quick links jump page in the middle.

```html
<head>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/muzihuaner/QuickLinks@main/assets/QuickLinks.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<a href="javascript:travelling()" title="快链-友链接力"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/muzihuaner/QuickLinks@main/assets/QuickLinks.gif" alt="快链-友链接力" width="120"></a>

## Q&A

### Q：Can only blogs join?

A：**Any webpage is fine**.

Blogs, homepages, tools, navigation, etc. are all available, as long as it is a webpage that is willing to share, you can join the quick link.

### Q：How to support QuickLinks?

A：There are two options.

- [Use Quicklinks] Place the quicklinks logo on your webpage to help promote more people to join the quicklinks.
- [Reward the author](https://huangetech.gitee.io/pay)

### Q：Can Quicklink increase the traffic of my webpage?

A：**In theory,it'sOK**.

Inappropriate estimation: Assuming that there are currently 2 web pages that have joined the quicklinks, and each page has 10 people using the quicklinks, then each page seems to increase the traffic of `10*2*1/2=10`; if Does having 10 webpages joined the quicklinks still increase the traffic of 10 people on average? Obviously not because:

- Visitors can use the quicklinks to connect multiple times;
- If there are more web pages with quicklinks, the hits per site will increase;

Then we calculate, 10 webpages joined the quicklinks, the number of relays increased to 3, each page has 15 people using the quicklinks, then each page will increase the traffic of `15*10*3/10=45` .
This is also the reason why it is recommended to place the quicklinks logo in an obvious position on your webpage (recommended top bar, sidebar), so that you can go down directly and get more traffic.

In fact, since there is no statistical code, it is not clear about the specific changes in traffic. But it seems that there are more webmasters applying to join, so I think that quicklinks is beneficial to web traffic-at least webmasters can make friends with each other ;-)

### Q：Is the fast chain safe and will not violate privacy?

A：Security, no invasion of privacy.

All https anti-hijacking; open source, no statistical code, no invasion of privacy; automatic deployment of mirroring, no manual intervention. All webpages added to Quicklink are manually screened to ensure that the traffic is clean and high-quality from the source.

### Q：What does Quicklink bring to webmasters and visitors?

A：The network once moved from closed to open, and now it has moved to closed. In this environment, the traffic of independent web pages (similar to "independent games") is more or less affected. quicklinks tries to make traditional friend chains "live", allowing web pages to relay each other, allowing traffic to flow between each other, and opening up the network.

- Webmaster: You support the opening of the network and get more traffic.
- Visitors: Discover more high-quality webpages, an online travel that just walks away.

### Q：I want to modify the logo to match my webpage?

A：There are various picture materials in the `assets` folder, which can be modified and self-hosted.

### Q ：I need to change the URL or other information

A:  Raise an issue!

You can also set up a redirect as early as possible before the domain name expires, and the Quick links will also notice and correct the URL during maintenance.

> 💡 When buying a domain name, don't just pay attention to whether it is cheap, but also pay attention to the **renewal** price. Static URLs can try Vercel hosting.

### Q：Report the problem page or exit the fast link?

A：Raise an issue!
